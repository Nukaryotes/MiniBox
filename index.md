# MiniBox

__MiniBox is an alternative for Busybox and Toybox.__
__MiniBox yet does not support all the featues that__
__are supported by Busybox and Toybox because this__
__is still under development.__


## Why this project??

__This project is a very interesting idea of rewritting almost all__
__possible unix utilities and bringing them into one executable file.__
__Though many unix-utility suites like BusyBox, ToyBox have made__
__it but, we want to make things more faster and optimised.__
