# MiniBox
MiniBox is an alternative for Busybox and Toybox.
MiniBox yet does not support all the featues that
are supported by Busybox and Toybox because this
is still under development.

## Why this project??
This project is a very interesting idea of rewritting almost all
possible unix utilities and bringing them into one executable file.
Though many unix-utility suites like BusyBox, ToyBox have made it but,
we want to make things more faster and optimised.
